The assessment of sprint (horizontal) mechanical properties has recently become popular since a simple method for estimating force, power and mechanical efficiency was published [@morinSimpleMethodComputing2019; @samozinoSimpleMethodMeasuring2016]. The outcomes from this method have potential value for sports scientists to help identify limitations of short sprint performance or evaluate return to play for injured athletes [@haugenSprintMechanicalVariables2019; @mendiguchiaProgressionMechanicalProperties2014; @morinInterpretingPowerForceVelocityProfiles2016]. To date, the literature provides descriptions of sprint characteristics of male [@morinSimpleMethodComputing2019; @samozinoSimpleMethodMeasuring2016; @buchheitMechanicalDeterminantsAcceleration2014; @edwardsSprintAccelerationCharacteristics2020], and female [@haugenSprintMechanicalVariables2019; @marcote-pequenoAssociationForceVelocity2019; @jimenez-reyesRelationshipVerticalHorizontal2018; @haugenSprintMechanicalProperties2020], for a wide range of sports but there is variation in the hardware and technology used that could influence the resulting kinetic outcomes.

The use of force plates is considered the gold standard for assessing mechanical properties of sprinting; however, there are logistical and financial challenges to capturing the profile of an entire sprint [@morinSimpleMethodComputing2019; @samozinoSimpleMethodMeasuring2016]. Radar and laser technology are frequently used field-based methods [@buchheitMechanicalDeterminantsAcceleration2014; @edwardsSprintAccelerationCharacteristics2020; @jimenez-reyesRelationshipVerticalHorizontal2018; @marcote-pequenoAssociationForceVelocity2019] but not commonly accessible to most practitioners working in sports.  Some researchers have also used timing gates [@buchheitMechanicalDeterminantsAcceleration2014; @haugenSprintMechanicalProperties2020; @haugenSprintMechanicalVariables2019] and incorporate the split times into the method for determining sprint mechanical properties [@morinSimpleMethodComputing2019; @samozinoSimpleMethodMeasuring2016]. A potential challenge of using timing gates is an inability to identify the first instance of force generation, so a correction factor (0.5 sec) to sprint time has been recommended [@haugenSprintMechanicalProperties2020; @haugenSprintMechanicalVariables2019] but not always used [@buchheitMechanicalDeterminantsAcceleration2014; @haugenPowerForceVelocityProfilingSprinting2020; @rakovicEffectIndividualisedSprint2018]. Interestingly, the average difference between using timing gates and a block start for 40 m sprint time was 0.27 sec [@haugenDifferenceStartImpact2012].  While a timing correction factor is warranted to avoid subsequent errors in estimates of kinetic variables (e.g., overestimate power), a correction factor that is too large will have the opposite effect (e.g., underestimate power).

PARAGRAPH ON MODELS and MODEL PARAMETERS???

Ultimately sport science practitioners will use the most common field-based testing method (i.e., timing gates) and need better models to accurately estimate sprint kinetic parameters.  Therefore, the aim of the current study was to use sprint split times collected from timing gates and examine various models and determine which might be best suited for female athletes.

# Matherial and Methods

This was a retrospective exploratory analysis using a sub-set of data from a total of 220 high-level female athletes (151 soccer players and 69 field hockey players).  This was a preliminary study to test a range of models and the reason for including a portion of the available athletes.  Using a random number generator, a total of 52 players (35 soccer and 17 field hockey) were selected for the current analysis.  Soccer players were older (24.6±3.6 vs. 18.9±2.7 yr, p < 0.000), however there were no differences for height (167.3±5.9 vs. 167.0±5.7 cm, p = 0.886), body mass (62.5±5.9 vs. 64.0±9.4 kg, p = 0.500) or any sprint interval time (p > 0.650).

The protocol for assessing linear sprint speed has been described previously [@vescoviImpactMaximumSpeed2014; @vescoviLocomotorHeartRateMetabolic2016; @vescoviSprintSpeedCharacteristics2012] and was identical for each cohort.  Briefly, all athletes performed a standardized warm-up that included general exercises such as jogging, shuffling, multi-directional movements, and dynamic stretching exercises. Infrared timing gates (Brower Timing, Utah) were positioned at the start line and at 5, 10, 20, and 35 meters at a height of approximately 1.0 meter. Participants stood with their lead foot positioned approximately 5 cm behind the initial infrared beam (i.e., start line). Only forward movement was permitted (no leaning or rocking backwards) and timing started when the laser of the starting gate was triggered. The best 35 m time, and all associated split times were kept for analysis.  The assessment of linear sprints using infrared timing gates does not require familiarization [@moirInfluenceFamiliarizationReliability2004].
